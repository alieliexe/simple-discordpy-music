# simple-discordpy-music
A simple discord music bot written in Python. Do note that this code is not written with any object-oriented-programming.
To work it need several Library. Such as:
1. Discord.py
2. PyNacL
3. asyncio
4. yt-dlp/yt-dl(may require some changes)
5. youtube-search
6. FFMPEG

Still have not tried to host it for 24/7, so error may occur.
